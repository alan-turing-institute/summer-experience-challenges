##  The Vaccinating Drone

*Taking inspiration from the great MIT Media Lab [Ethics for AI course](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e9wx9oBg7CR0s5O7YnYHVmX7H7pnITfoDxNdrSGkp60/view).*

**Summary:** The challenge requires the students to develop an AI system for a fictional vaccinating drone. We tell the students there's been a viral outbreak that's targeting dogs and cats, and the government wants to deploy drones that locate stray dogs and cats on the streets for vaccination.However, the vaccines for dogs and cats *are different*, and the system should be able to distinguish between them using its camera.

**Learning themes and outcomes:** 

- Understand how a classification model works, using *training data* within an 
*algorithm* to *predict* the label 
of instances not seen before.
- Understand the impact of biases in training data in prediction quality, and how it can impact our society.
- Describe what engineers can do to mitigate the effects of biased systems.


**Sessions:** _Rough outline of what participants/facilitators can do in each of these four sessions:_

- 5 min video pitch - Mon
- Introduction (0.5 hours) - Thurs
- Main challenge session 1 (1.5 hours) - Thurs
- Main challenge session 2 (1.5 hours) - Fri
- Challenge wrap-up/presentation preparation (students will be asked to present what they did) (1 hour) - Fri

**Opportunities for Collaboration:** _Summary of how teamwork and collaboration can feature in this challenge_

**Development plan:** _Requirements and plans for developing the challenge - what needs to be done_

**Development time:** _An estimate of how long it will take to prepare the challenge_

**Delivery plan:** _Requirements and plans for delivering the challenge during the week - what will students need, what will facilitators/helpers need to do etc._

**Questions/risks:** _Any outstanding questions or potential risks in preparing/delivering the challenge (e.g. is there anything that might cause the development to take much longer, or anything that could compromise the delivery of the challenge on the day?)_
