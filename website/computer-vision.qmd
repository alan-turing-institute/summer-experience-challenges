Build your own model to distinguish between cats and dogs, and understand how biases in datasets may lead to it behaving unpredictably!

## Overview

The challenge requires the students to develop an AI system for a fictional vaccinating drone. We tell the students there's been a viral outbreak that's targeting dogs and cats, and the government wants to deploy drones that locate stray dogs and cats on the streets for vaccination. However, the vaccines for dogs and cats are different, and the system should be able to distinguish between them using its camera.

Learning themes and outcomes:

- Understand how a classification model works, using training data within an algorithm to predict the label of instances not seen before.
- Understand the impact of biases in training data in prediction quality, and how it can impact our society.
- Describe what engineers can do to mitigate the effects of biased systems.


## Getting Started
