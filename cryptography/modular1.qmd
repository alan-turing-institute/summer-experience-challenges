# Modular arithmetic I

To begin the second part of this challenge, we'll take a brief look at *modular arithmetic*.
This is the same thing as regular arithmetic, but with one twist: we only care about the remainder when dividing by some number $n$.

Instead of talking about numbers, we talk about numbers *modulo* $n$.
For example, $5 \bmod 3 = 2$, because the remainder when dividing $5$ by $3$ is $2$. In fact, you already know how to do this:

![$11 + 4 = 15 \equiv 3\bmod 12$](images/400px-Modular_clocks.png)

When we tell the time we implicitly work in arithmetic modulo 12, which is why we know that 3pm is 4 hours after 11am. 
Modular arithmetic can also be thought of as performing the same operation on clocks with a different number of hours to 12.

Going back to the example above, $5 \bmod 3 = 2$, we see also that $8 \bmod 3 = 2$; so $5$ and $8$ are equivalent, or *congruent*, modulo $3$.

Essentially, $a$ and $b$ are congruent modulo $n$ if $a$ and $b$ have the same remainder when divided by $n$.

This is often denoted as:

$$5 \equiv 8 \bmod 3.$$

We can insert any other expressions we like in here, as well:

$$1 + 4 \equiv 4 \times 2 \bmod 3.$$

Another way of thinking about this is that integers 'wrap around' back to 0 after reaching $n - 1$.
So, when counting *modulo* $3$, instead of $$0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, \ldots$$ we have: $$0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, \ldots$$

Because $5$ and $8$ both 'become' the same number, they are congruent modulo $3$.

## Calculator

To help you get a feel for modular arithmetic, here is a calculator that accepts (almost) any mathematical expression in the left-hand side.
You can also specify a modulus, and the calculator will show you the result of the expression modulo that number.
You may find this useful for the exercises below.

## Exercises

Suppose that $a \equiv p \bmod n$ and $b \equiv q \bmod n$.
Prove the following statements:

1. $(a + b) \equiv (p + q) \bmod n$.
1. $(ab) \equiv (pq) \bmod n$.
1. $(a^m) \equiv (p^m) \bmod n$, for all non-negative integers $m$.

<!-- Note: the last one requires proof by induction, or a simplified form thereof. -->

These equalities make it far easier to perform some calculations.
For example, what is $33^{594} \bmod{32}$?

We might first think about calculating $33$ to the power of $594$, and *then* dividing that by $32$ to find the remainder.
That sounds difficult: even a computer would struggle with such a large number! (Try using the calculator above, or [Google's built-in calculator](https://www.google.com/search?q=calculator), to calculate $33^{594}$.)

But if we notice that $33 \equiv 1 \bmod{32}$, then we can use formula (3) to see that

$$33^{594} \equiv 1^{594} \equiv 1 \bmod{32},$$

because $1$ to the power of anything is still $1$.

> **Challenge:** Calculate $7^{175} \bmod{16}$.

<!-- The correct answer is 7, because 7^2 = 49 = (16 * 3) + 1 = 1 mod 16.
So 7^n for any even n = 1 mod 16, and 7^n for any odd n = 7 mod 16.
If the students have trouble seeing this, try to get them to see the 'pattern' in 7^1 mod 16, 7^2 mod 16, 7^3 mod 16, 7^4 mod 16, ... which the calculator *will* correctly calculate.
