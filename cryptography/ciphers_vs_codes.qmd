# Codes and Ciphers

We may often talk of "code-breaking", or the "Enigma code", but in fact there is a subtle distinction between the meanings of *code* and *cipher*.

A *code* is a mapping from some meaningful concept (a word, or a sentence), to an arbitrary symbol (perhaps a letter or a number).   For example, we might have a code that assigns the sentence "It's very cold today" to the number "67".  There's no particular logic behind that, we just decided it, and wrote down this mapping in our *code book* so that it can be decoded later on.

Today though, we will be looking at *ciphers*.
While a *code* operates on *meanings*, a *cipher* operates on *symbols* (such as individual letters).  It transforms the "plaintext" symbols to their "ciphertext" counterparts using an *algorithm*.   This algorithm will usually be a mathematical operation involving the original message and some sort of *key*.   If someone knows (or is able to deduce) the algorithm and the key, they will be able to decipher an encrypted message.


## Words and punctuation

Suppose Alice wanted to use a simple "mono-alphabetic cipher" (we'll come to what that means in a bit) to send a message to her friend Bob.   The message might look like:

WLJJB MBM,

WBP FVC UBQ?

FJORL

Could we use some simple logic and guesswork to have a go at decrypting this?

Hints:

 -  What are common ways of greeting people?
 -  Since we know the names of both the sender and the recipient, could we look for those somewhere in the message?
 -  Look for things like double-letters, or places where the same letter appears in different words.


As a very basic step, even before we worry about what encryption algorithm to use, we can make life more difficult for someone who wants to snoop on our messages by taking a few simple steps.

 -  Ignore spaces, new lines, and punctuation.
 -  Put letters into e.g. groups of five.

It would be much harder for someone to try to decrypt:

WLJJB MBMWB PFVCU BQFJO RL

than the message above!
