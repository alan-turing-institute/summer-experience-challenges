# Modular arithmetic II

## Introduction

In this section, we'll look at the *extended Euclidean algorithm*, a series of steps which can be used to solve the equation:

$$ax + by = \gcd(a, b) \tag{1}$$

where $a$, $b$, $x$, and $y$ are all integers, and $\gcd(a, b)$ denotes the *greatest common divisor* of $a$ and $b$, i.e. the largest whole number that divides both $a$ and $b$.

Formulated this way, this equation might not immediately seem relevant.
However, in fact, it is precisely what we need to find the value of $d$ in the RSA algorithm.

Recall that we chose $e$ and $d$ such that:

- $e$ and $\phi$ have no common factors. This means that $\gcd(e, \phi) = 1$.
- $ed \bmod \phi = 1$.

> **Question:** Reformulate the second condition in terms of equation (1).



## The extended Euclidean algorithm

You probably found above that we are trying to solve the equation $ed + \phi y = 1$.
We already know the values of $e$ and $\phi$, and the Euclidean algorithm will let us obtain the values of $d$ and $y$.

Of course, we're only really interested in $d$, so even though we'll also get the value of $y$, we can just throw it away.

Let's reuse the example from the previous page, where $\phi = 48$ and $e = 5$.
Substituting that in:

$$5d + 48y = 1$$

Each step of the Euclidean algorithm is a simple division.
We start off with the larger number (48), and divide it by the smaller number (5).
In this case, $48$ divided by $5$ is $9$, with a remainder of $3$:

$$\underset{\text{big number}}{\color{blue}{48}} = (9 \times \underset{\text{small number}}{\color{red}{5}}) + \underset{\text{remainder}}{\color{green}{3}}$$

We repeat this, but the small number from the previous equation ($5$) becomes the 'big number', and the remainder ($3$) becomes the 'small number'.

$$\underset{\text{big number}}{\color{blue}{5}} = (1 \times \underset{\text{small number}}{\color{red}{3}}) + \underset{\text{remainder}}{\color{green}{2}}$$

And again:

$$\underset{\text{big number}}{\color{blue}{3}} = (1 \times \underset{\text{small number}}{\color{red}{2}}) + \underset{\text{remainder}}{\color{green}{1}}$$

And we can stop when we get to the remainder of $1$, because that's the number on the right-hand side of our original equation!

But how does this help us to find $d$ and $y$?

Well, we can rewrite each of the equations above by bringing the remainders to one side:

$$\begin{align}
{\color{green}{3}} &= {\color{blue}{48}} - (9 \times {\color{red}{5}}) \\
{\color{green}{2}} &= {\color{blue}{5}} - (1 \times {\color{red}{3}}) \\
{\color{green}{1}} &= {\color{blue}{3}} - (1 \times {\color{red}{2}})
\end{align}$$

At the very top, we have an equation that links 3 to our original numbers, 48 and 5.
At the bottom, we have an equation that links our target 1 to 3 and 2.
So we just need to substitute the equations above into the ones below, in order to relate our target 1 to the original 48 and 5.

> **Exercise:** Substitute the equations above into the third equation to express 1 in terms of multiples of 48 and 5. You will have to do this in several steps to make sure that all the 2's and 3's are eliminated.

You might eventually end up at this answer:

$$1 = (\underset{y}{2} \times \underset{\phi}{48}) + (\underset{d}{-19} \times \underset{e}{5}).$$

which suggests that $d = -19$ and $y = 2$.

But we can't have a negative number for $d$!

Thankfully, we can add and subtract multiples of $48$ and $5$:

\begin{align}
1 &= (2 \times 48) - (19 \times 5) \\
  &= (2 \times 48) - (5 \times 48) + (48 \times 5) - (19 \times 5) \\
  &= (\underset{y}{-3} \times \underset{\phi}{48}) + (\underset{d}{29} \times \underset{e}{5}).
\end{align}

which tells us that $d = 29$ is a valid choice for the decryption key.

As we will soon see, the values of $p$ and $q$ actually used in practice are *extremely* large!
So, having a fast algorithm to calculate $d$ is very important.
