# RSA scheme

The RSA scheme is a public-key cryptosystem. It is based on the fact that it is easy to multiply two large prime numbers, but it is difficult to factorize a large number. The RSA scheme is based on the following assumptions:

1. It is easy to multiply two large prime numbers.
2. It is difficult to factorize a large number.
3. It is easy to compute the remainder of a large number when divided by a small number.
4. It is difficult to compute the remainder of a large number when divided by a large number.
5. It is easy to compute the remainder of a large number when divided by a small number.
6. It is difficult to compute the remainder of a large number when divided by a large number.
7. It is easy to compute the remainder of a large number when divided by a small number.
8. It is difficult to compute the remainder of a large number when divided by a large number.

It was proven that the RSA scheme is secure if the following conditions are met:

1. The prime numbers p and q are chosen at random.
2. The product n = pq is a large number.
3. The public key is (n, e) and the private key is (n, d).
4. The public key is published.
5. The private key is kept secret.
6. The message m is an integer such that 0 < m < n.
7. The ciphertext c is an integer such that 0 < c < n.
