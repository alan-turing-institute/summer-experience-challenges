# The Vaccinating Drone

Teachable Machines is available at: https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/train


## Delivery Notes

- It is important to keep pacing in mind. The challenge sessions is almost 4 hours.
- We have added two external resources for the students to explore: a webpage on basic neural networks, and another one on CNNs. Letting students explore this resources individually (for 15 minutes each) seems productive and can trigger interesting questions.
- Breaks are important, we should at least two (one in the morning, and one in the afternoon). It is also key to coordinate breaks with the other challenges, so students can mingle with other groups.
- Be sure to make the URLs needed easily available (in the whiteboard, or on screen). They will need access to GitHub, Teachable Machines, the slides, and the external resources.
- For the demonstration of Teachable Machines with the figurines, we should devote at least 45 minutes. Students seem to enjoy this first contact with computer vision.
- For the demonstration of bias with the cat-dog dataset, we should take 20 minutes. The recurating dataset training should take less, about 15 minutes.
- The competition is the most engaging bit, you should devote at least 45 minutes. Keep scores in a visible place (whiteboard), to generate excitement.
- **Teachable machine can fail** and get into an infinite loop while training. We need to detect this early, and have a backup plan (clear browser cache?)
